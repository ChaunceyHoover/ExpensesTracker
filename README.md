# ExpensesTracker
A learning application to track shared expenses between roomies.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to help @joshuawcampb learn more about databases and web application.

### Technologies
Because this is a learning exercise, we decided to create a simple application using only a few tools at a time.

#### ASP.NET 7
I decided to go with ASP.NET 7 because I personally use .NET 6 at my work right now and wanted to see if there were any noticeable differences between 6 and 7. Also, I was writing the web application and left Josh in charge of the database work, so I wanted to give him an example of not being able to choose the frameworks you're given when you're on the job. I think Node.js would have been a better choice since we're not using Microsoft SQL, but unfortunately, you don't always get to pick your tool set in the work environment.

#### MariaDB
To help Josh learn about database applications, we decided to go with MySQL / MariaDB to get started with databases. While Microsoft SQL would have been a better choice since we used ASP.NET for the web application, I have had to use MariaDB in the past with .NET and don't have an issue using whatever tools are provided.

I provided Josh with three example tables and one example view. All the rest of the tables and queries were written by him. This includes populating the database with data and all the queries written in the web application.
